#### Learning goals for this lesson: 

* Understand the parameters that characterize normal distributions.
* Can create and visualize normal distributions using python packages. 
* Interpret the standard score of an observation from normally distributed data.
* Know how to standardize normal distributions. 
* Define the significance threshold $\alpha$ and its relation to p-value. 
* Define null and alternative hypotheses, and when they're used. 
* Use scipy methods to compute the p value of a z-score and are able to interpet the significance of results. 
* Understand and can perform 1-sample z-tests, and can grasp the difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.  

#### Misconceptions / Notes

* Computing two-tailed one-sample z-tests may cause confusion.
